Comp Sci 467: Multimedia Systems



## About the project

This project was created for my Computer Science 467: Multimedia Systems class. 

The object was recreating a production ready python script that was similar to a project my professor had used for Sony Productions.


## Features
 - CLI Interface.
 - Accepts MP4 Files.
 - Utilizes FFMPeg to process the clips for screenshots.
 - Will process workorders (see /xytech_samples) using RegEx.
 - Outputs to CSV or XLSX.

## Samples
--/Baselight_samples and /flame_samples represents the filepaths from a NAS system. These samples are used to locate the available frames.
--/Xytech_sample is an example work order that would come in from a PM.
--MP4 sample was a clip provided to use for screenshots in the identified frames from xytech_samples.
